This project is a dating website. It is a multi-page web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on responsive design and interactive features. The website includes core functionalities such as user authentication with a two-step verification system using simple arithmetic questions to ensure human login, and a password recovery system that securely manages user credentials through JSON files. Users can create and update profiles, and the platform uses JavaScript-based algorithms to match users based on shared hobbies and interests. The user interface is styled using CSS with background gradients and embedded videos to enhance the overall experience. This project demonstrates practical implementation of frontend web development, user input handling, and basic data storage mechanisms in a standalone browser-based environment.
